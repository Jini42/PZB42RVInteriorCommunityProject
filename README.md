# PZB42RVInteriorCommunityProject
Fork of Community ran Project Zomboid B42 RV Interior Mod from Janger

All credits to original mod author Maxwell, his credits as well as the author of Doomsday Motorhome mod

RV_Interior_simpl is a very simple working version, manual installation required 


Current status:
- hardcoded vehicles that have an interior (for now I have put some vanilla vehicles in a list)
- can only enter from inside vehicle via radial menu
- exit via context menu while inside interior, going back to previous seat in vehicle
- only using one map, so multiple vehicles share the same interior
- generator not sync with car battery, for now it is always set to max fuel max condition
- the sandbox options check (if zombies nearby or chasing) exist but not used (should work though)
- sink / plumbing not implemented yet
- no multiplayer
- no hotkeys
- i have seen a zombie spawn inside interior once


Planned: adding features from original mod bit by bit
